We get that every time we're here,
Right now, we have the halibut
The water changes
We weren't getting any this year
Is this permanent? We'll see what happens.
We need to take all our cars to be washed,
  it was a very dirty rain
    a very dirty rain.
Not much
  can you freeze it?
Its supposed to rain tomorrow,
  but we need it
Hence the salad bowl...


Oh, really?
Wow
  the last time that happened was 1981
A dusting, a sprinkle
  just enough to water the flowers.
