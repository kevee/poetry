Running on a high savannah,
Between oak trees and the threads
Of daffodil seeds, among the tall people
Named oat, grass, buckwheat, sedge,
Dried twigs snap, squirrel warrens crumble.
Lichens goan on their pebble hosts.
Ants on tall mortises are fallen, eaten in turn
By their own gleeful sisters.
Bumble bees alight on the last lupine.

She has found some place
Deep in a coastal mountain pass,
Where valleys hang ragged
Kept secret by paper wasps and poison oak.
Springs sneak 
Under roots of white sage.
A doe drunks, jumps up a ridge
Within the burnt trunks of a madrone
Bumble bees tend their larvae, blessed.

This is a soild which the plough
Has not rent, lighting still burns.
She lies in dappled light on a
Mossy rock, where wrens sing
On other days.
Silence to our ear is a chorus to others
She does not perceive the granite
Bulging under the swift pressure
Of mountains finding space.

She sits up to wanter,
Borne from loam and ocean's froth
To a gentile hovel of redwood feed.
Carrying a sense of grief that no bumble bee
Could have need to know.
Compound eyes roll through the sex of flowers,
Die in a landing of petals.
Having two simple, hazel eyes, she has
Seen betrayal, violence, too much beauty.

Ants know the way
To food without a hurried through
Bumble bees spurn the dark
With pollen safely hit
Slie quietly in earth like
Her steps on the castings of
Worms, and tendrils of mushrooms
Turning the last of us
To another mighty sycamore.

The mountains have no space,
But plenty of time.
She walks past the
Dying light of day,
Her home is a lean-to of branches.
A pasture of ring-tailed cats
Pass by, as always, unnoticed.
She has plenty of space,
But no time.

Beyond the next high ridge
Lies a beach: rough sand scoured
By the shadows of driftwood.
Plovers dance on the edge of the world,
Each small step erased quickly.
Nests among buckwheat gone by summer.
She feels a thrumming, low
In the incense of her belly
Plucked by unceasing waves.

In the cavernous silence,
Voles sing to fallen leaves,
Oaks spin stories, and mushrooms
Weave their tapestries.
Her birthday song is sung.
Acorn woodpeckers knock
A beat thirty-six times,
One solitary grainery per year.
Tannins for the bitter days.

In a blackberry glen,
Where hares sit watching,
In the poppyseed moonlight,
She struggles to tell Mars from Venus.
Owl pellets shine
With the silver hairs of squirrels.
She crumbles one in her hand,
Feels bones of tiny fingers,
Disembodied in a daily prayer.

The full moon follows
As she makes a bed of pine down.
Centipedes rustle in the roots of sage,
Disturbing only their gentile prey
Until the night yields.
This mountain hides the self
Like a hawk’s shadow over a gopher’s den.
Fear is not a way to keep life
The sea reminds us of impending time.

The closer I move to
Light, the more I learn of its end.
Our little death is
A tragedy and a blessing
I am a vulture,
Waiting patiently for the fallen.
My sinews now features,
Red face stewing in mid-day heat,
Ride air forced from the sea.

I am awoken by
Humming from a spider’s web.
Hear the thunderclap of dew
Dripping from spanish moss.
There is no greener fall than the
Charred twigs of a sprung valley! Oh,
Cross this spring-fed
River, it will carry you out toward life.
