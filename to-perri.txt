To Perri

There are always shooting stars to see, but the sun, 
or the moon, or our own wonderful distractions, or our
eye's limited attention, or our thoughts, or our
streetlights, or our airplane windows,
  prevent us from seeing them.

This is a blessing: if we saw a meteorite
slough off a billion years of accruement
in less than a second every hour,
if we ticked off nights
by mere dust trailing a comet's close
approach, if a shooting start was just a star,
then I would not remember so clearly the two I saw with you

Sleeping like a row of ducks, I
was awoken by the thrum of the milk
way's vibratto, taugh strings of galaxies and dust,
hummed by the sage-scented rosin of
the Santa Lucias. The eight inches of ground
between us lost against the pale blueness of
our rocky outcrop.
